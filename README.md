# Fixed width docker file generation

The application generates a fixed width file by reading the configuration for each column from spec.json. The generated fixed width file will be left justified.
The application also parses the generated fixed width file to generate a csv file. The type of the data for each column is considered to be string.

## Spec.json
### Attributes

- **Offsets**: list of lengths for each column defined. Should be in string format
- **FixedWidthEncoding**: Type of encoding required to generate fixed width file
- **DelimitedEncoding**: Type of encoding required to generate csv file
- **IncludeHeader**: Boolean value (True adds the column names as header)

1. Clone the repository
2. cd fixed_width_file_generation
3. docker build -t fixed-width-file .
4. docker run fixed-width-file
5. docker exec [container_name] bash
